## The truth about CheatBreaker 2
As a CheatBreaker 2 veteran(I joined before it was even public), and after getting to know their team and how they work, I feel pretty justified to make this. Mostly I will be discussing their leadership. Why? Beacuse it's the sole reason why I consider the client bad.

### Tellinq
Tellinq is the owner and main developer of CheatBreaker 2. If you ever joined the discord you will know him. Well, you might ask, why is he here, on this document? and to that I respond beacuse of his power abuse(a prominent subject in this document). What am I talking about? Well, let me guide you trough all his abuses upon me. When he introduced a new rule, no using or discussing modified discord clients, I moved to normal discord, and provided proof, and for that I got timed out for a week.

### Nox
Nox is an other developer of CheatBreaker 2. He also power abuses(What a surprise). Me and him had an argument in Notro Dan's discord server, and guess what? He times me out for a week with no reason given. Not to mention he probably hijacked [Kay's Domain](https://ignkay.tk). Why am I making this claim? Well, When you go to the website, there's the cicadda 3301 puzzle, and guess what Nox has on his website? The same puzzle.
